# Absentee Highlighter 🏫
This project is a small showcase of my favorite features of `openpyxl`. 
It takes a large membership file and iterates through the data to create a 
smaller 'roll call' file, which highlight members with excessive absent days.
Check out [this blog post]() to learn more.

## To Run Locally
- Install package `openpyxl`
